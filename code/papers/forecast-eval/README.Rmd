```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      eval = FALSE)
```
### Generate results
Results text including numbers and figures can be created with
```{r results_full}
rmarkdown::render(here::here("code", "papers", "forecast-eval", "results.Rmd"))
```

### Data access

To access the raw dataset of forecasts used here, use:
```{r get-forecasts}
source(here::here(file_path, "R", "get-forecasts.R"))
```

To access the evaluation scores used here, use:
```{r get-eval}
source(here::here(file_path, "R", "get-eval.R"))
```
Anonymous responses to the survey are saved in an excel file: `data/survey-responses.xlsx`

### Analysis

All code is written in R and designed with the European hub repo as the root directory.

First set a common file path to this folder to avoid navigating through the whole hub repository:
```{r file-path, eval = TRUE}
file_path <- here::here("code", "papers", "forecast-eval")
```

#### Description of forecasts
Code to support description of the forecast models by various stratifications (team, locations, horizons, variable):

```{r forecast-description}
here::here(file_path, "R", "forecast-description.R")
```

#### Forecast scoring

Forecasts were scored using the cut off date 2021-08-23. Note that all models are included with a minimum of any four forecasts. This is different from the weekly evaluation, where only models that have submitted in the last four weeks continuously are included. 
```{r eval_run}
here::here(file_path, "R", "re-run-eval.R")
```

See also the weekly code to create the evaluation scores, saved under: `here::here("code", "reports", "evaluation")`. 

#### Score summaries

Describe and plot models' relative AE and get the top ranked models with:
```{r score-summaries-rel-ae}
here::here(file_path, "R", "model-relative-ae.R")
```

![_Figure: Number of top ranked models by relative AE_](./figures/2021-09-01-top-models.png)


Get and plot coverage with:
```{r score-summaries-coverage}
here::here(file_path, "R", "coverage.R")
```
![_Figure: Coverage_](./figures/model-coverage.png)


Calculate and plot average score by location with:
```{r score-summaries-location}
here::here(file_path, "R", "location-absolute-score.R")
```
![_Figure: Average score by location_](./figures/location-absolute-score.png)


Load truth data and plot for a single location (here for France) with:

```{r score-summaries-truth}
here::here(file_path, "R", "plot-single-location.R")
```
